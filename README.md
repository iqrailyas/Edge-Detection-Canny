Face Detection and Segmentation
Project Overview
It focuses on edge detection and segmentation of faces from uploaded photos using various machine-learning techniques.

Objectives
Upload and Preprocess Photo: Allow users to upload a photo containing a face and preprocess it for analysis.
Edge Detection: Apply edge detection techniques to highlight facial features and boundaries in the uploaded photo.
Face Segmentation: Perform segmentation to isolate the face from the rest of the image.
Compare Approaches: Display results using multiple existing approaches to assess their effectiveness.
Steps
1. Upload and Preprocess Photo
Implement functionality for users to upload a photo.
Preprocess the photo (e.g., resize, normalize) for consistent analysis.
2. Edge Detection
Use algorithms such as:
Canny Edge Detection
Sobel Operator
Prewitt Operator
Highlight the edges and contours of the face.
3. Face Segmentation
Apply segmentation techniques, including:
Thresholding
Watershed Algorithm
Deep Learning Models (e.g., U-Net)
Isolate the face region from the background.
4. Displaying Results
Compare and visualize results from different approaches:
Edge Detection Methods: Show how each method delineates facial features.
Segmentation Methods: Display how each method separates the face from the rest of the image.
Provide insights into the effectiveness and accuracy of each approach.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for implementing algorithms.
OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks.
TensorFlow/Keras: Frameworks for deep learning-based segmentation.
Matplotlib: Library for visualizing results.
